Regarding merges of models
1) define main model and add model
2) iterate through all resources of the add model and check if they are contained within the main model
3) if a resource is contained within the main model
3.1) check if the data properties of the add model are contained within the resource of the main model;
if that is the case remove the corresponding data property from the main model.
3.2) check if the add model and the main model contain a blank node, if yes remove the blank node from the
main model.
3.3) in theory check, if the main model and the add model both contain object properties, if yes, check
if there is an existing ontology and check if the corresponding class of the object property is allowed
to contain more than one. if this is not the case, remove the object property of the main model. This might
lead to the interesting case of a disconnected resource in the main model, if the corresponding resource
is not further linked by other object properties. In this case removing of this resource might be required.

It seems there is a problem with listing Resources, if a Resource is a top level node.
Top level node is a node that has a URI, references other nodes, but is not referenced
by other nodes. In this case, Apache Jena will not list it as a Resource.
In the use case this is true for the Project Resource which is not referenced by any other node.
